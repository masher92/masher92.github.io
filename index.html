		<h3> MSc River Basin Dynamics and Management with GIS </h3>
	
		<h4> Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Advanced Skills</h4>
		<p> Work done towards the GEOG_5790 module at the University of Leeds, including: <br />
		<ul>
		<li>A <a href = "https://github.com/masher92/GEOG_5790" target="_blank">portfolio</a> of projects based on: XML, SQLite, Pandas, Bokeh, NLTK, Cellular Automata and the ArcPy interface with ArcMap</li> 
		<li>A <a href = "https://github.com/masher92/GEOG_5790" target="_blank">Sample location generator</a> a program designed to provide a user with a set of locations in which to conduct manual sampling of peat depth in order to optomise performance of a geostatistical model of peat depth over an area of interest</li> 
		</ul>	
	
		<h4> Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills</h4>
		<p> Work done towards the GEOG_5990 module at the University of Leeds. <br />   
		    This includes creation of a simple agent-based model which constructs agents and places them in an environment. The agents interact with both each other and the environment. </p>
