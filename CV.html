		<h1 style="color:DarkBlue;" align="center">EMPLOYMENT in RESEARCH</h1>
		<h3> University of Leeds: Institute for Transport Studies, EMPOWER project (EU Horizon 2020)</h3>
		<h4> Project worker: February 2018 – May 2018</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Organised secure transfer of data from project partners in cities across Europe who had implemented a scheme encouraging uptake of sustainable travel options. </li>
			<li> Performed geostatistical analysis in R of GPS data from scheme participants. This involved mapping the journeys taken, identifying the most popular travel routes and analysing the success of the scheme across different times of day, parts of the city and user demographics. </i>
		</ul> 
		
		<h3> University of Leeds: Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA)</h3>
		<h4> Data science intern: September 2016 - May 2017</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> 4 months working with academics from POLIS (School of Politics and International Studies) investigating the success of the UK parliament’s e-petition system using data from conversations on Twitter. </li>
			<ul>
				<li> Analysed tweets on e-petitions using natural language processing and text mining in R. </i>
				<li> Conducted a social network analysis in R to assess who was taking part in the conversation, how they interacted and who the influential users were. </i>
			</ul>
			<li> 4 months working alongside Leeds City Council to analyse footfall data from cameras in the city centre from the last ten years. </i>
			<ul>
				<li>Cleaned and aggregated camera data and plotted it to gain insights into temporal trends in footfall.  </li>
				<li> Built a model in Python for predicting footfall based upon variables including day of the week, holidays (bank, school, university) and weather (rain and temperature).</li>
			</ul>
