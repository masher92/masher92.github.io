# Projects

I'm a PhD researcher in urban surface water flooding at the University of Leeds. I code in Python and run flood models in Hec-Ras. 

# 2019 - present

PhD project: Funded by NERC under the [Panorama DTP](https://panorama-dtp.ac.uk/), a collaboration between University of Leeds, University of York and University of Hull.  
_October 2019 - March 2021 FT, 6 month break from April 2021 - October 2021, October 2021 - present 0.6 FTE_

My project sits within the School of Civil Engineering, and the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science.  

Official title: Adaptation strategies to pluvial urban flood risk under UKCP18 climate change scenarios.  


# April 2021 to December 2023
Research assistant on the [DUST project](https://dust.leeds.ac.uk/)) in the School of Geography, University of Leeds.  
_April 2021-October 2021 FT, October 2021 to December 2023 0.4 FTE_

Including:
* Working on implementing/improving the parameter calibration in a dynamic microsimulation model of COVID-19 spread in Devon, as part of the [RAMP initiative](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/a-collaboration-to-support-the-work-of-pandemic-modelling-influencing-policy-and-saving-lives/)

* Work on developing a machine learning model of footfall in Melbourne based on weather, time based variables and characteristics of the urban environment
