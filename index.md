## About me
I'm a PhD researcher in urban surface water flooding at the University of Leeds. I code in Python and run flood models in Hec-Ras. 


    computational hydraulics at the University of Sheffield and I code in CUDA, C++ and Python. I use CUDA/C++ to develop high-performance GPU/CPU simulation codes, and Python to develop debugging and visualisation toolkits. I made the clip below by using Python to animate the results from my CUDA/C++ simulation projects. Aside from programming, I was an investment analyst before my PhD, where I worked in the venture capital team. I like working in diverse, skilled teams while contributing my best work as an individual to solve very complex problems.
